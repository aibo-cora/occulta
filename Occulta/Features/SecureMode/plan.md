# Secure Mode — Implementation Plan

## Implementation Order

**Phase 1 (ship-ready): Single-layer flat duress.** Steps 1–5 implement a fully functional PIN lock → duress PIN → decoy view with blob backup/restore and panic wipe. The plausible deniability stack (arbitrary-depth nesting) is designed but not built in Phase 1. The single-layer path covers 80% of the value and is the foundation everything else rests on.

**Phase 2 (post-ship): Multi-layer stacking.** Builds on Phase 1 without modifying its core flows. Begins after Phase 1 is tested end-to-end under adversarial conditions.

## Core Architecture — `Manager.Security`

`Manager.Security` is the single umbrella for all app-security hardening. `@Observable`, owned by `OccultaApp`, injected via `.environment`.

**State machine:**

```
.noPIN   — no PIN configured; app opens directly
.pinOnly — PIN set, Secure Mode not activated; PINEntry on every scene activation
.active  — Secure Mode active; full data visible
.duress  — duress PIN entered; decoy view; hidden contacts locked
```

State is derived from `SecureModeConfig` on every `init()` — never stored as a plaintext flag:
- `sealedDuressVerifier != nil` → `.active`
- `sealedNormalVerifier != nil` → `.pinOnly`
- no config → `.noPIN`

**Verifier scheme (no PBKDF2):**

`AES-GCM(HKDF(seKey, info: label ∥ pin), sentinel)`

SE key prevents all off-device attacks. PBKDF2 was removed: it added ~1s of main-thread blocking with no real security return — on-device code execution defeats any KDF regardless, and the 6-digit PIN space (1M) is brute-forceable in minutes on GPU independent of iteration count.

**`AppLayerConfig` — current schema (all properties optional, relevant ones encrypted):**

```swift
@Model final class AppLayerConfig {
    var sealedNormalVerifier:     Data?   // nil → .noPIN
    var sealedDuressVerifier:     Data?   // nil → .pinOnly
    var wipeThresholdEncrypted:   Data?   // encrypted Int; default 3
}
```

All properties optional to avoid SwiftData migration on schema evolution. `wipeThreshold` is encrypted because it reveals Secure Mode configuration to a forensic examiner.

Contact visibility is tracked per-contact on `Contact.Profile` via `visibleThroughDepth` (see Step 3). There is no central safe-contact list on `AppLayerConfig`.

**`Manager.Security` public interface:**

```swift
// Setup
func configurePIN(_ pin: String) throws                                              // .noPIN → .pinOnly
func activateSecureMode(confirmingNormalPIN: String, duressPIN: String) throws       // .pinOnly → .active
func deactivateSecureMode(confirmingNormalPIN: String) throws                        // .active/.duress → .pinOnly
func deactivatePIN(confirmingNormalPIN: String) throws                               // .pinOnly → .noPIN

// Verification (owns all state transitions)
func verify(_ pin: String) throws -> PINVerifyResult

// Safe contact membership
func isSafeContact(_ identifier: String) -> Bool
func safeContactIDs() -> Set<String>
func updateSafeContacts(_ ids: Set<String>) throws
```

**Interface contracts:**

- `deactivatePIN` is only valid in `.pinOnly`. Caller must deactivate Secure Mode first.
- `verify()` in `.noPIN` throws `.notConfigured` — `PINEntry` should never appear in that state.
- `isLocked: Bool` lives in `OccultaApp` (UI layer), not in `Manager.Security`. It is set to `true` on every `scenePhase == .active` when `security.requiresPIN`, and cleared to `false` in `onNormal`. `Manager.Security` owns state; `OccultaApp` owns the lock gate.

**Wipe threshold behaviour:**
- `.noPIN` / `.pinOnly` — no wipe
- `.active` / `.duress` — 3 wrong PINs → `.wipe`; N consecutive duress entries → `.wipe`

## Step 1 — PIN Infrastructure ✅

- [x] `Tags` enum `CaseIterable`, `secureModePin` case, `deleteAllKeys()`
- [x] `deriveSecureModeKey()` on `Manager.Key` and `KeyManagerProtocol`
- [x] `TestKeyManager` in-memory implementation
- [x] `SecureModeConfig` SwiftData model — all optional, `wipeThresholdEncrypted`, no salt, no boolean flags
- [x] `Manager.Security` — own `ModelContext`, `PINManager` internal, state machine `.noPIN/.pinOnly/.active/.duress`
- [x] `Manager.Security.configurePIN(_:)` — builds `sealedNormalVerifier`, inserts config, transitions `.noPIN → .pinOnly`
- [x] `Manager.Security.activateSecureMode(confirmingNormalPIN:duressPIN:)` — verifies normal PIN, builds `sealedDuressVerifier`; key rotation TODO deferred to Step 4
- [x] `Manager.Security.verify(_:)` — owns all state transitions; duress + wrong counters in memory
- [x] `Manager.Security.deactivatePIN(confirmingNormalPIN:)` — `.pinOnly → .noPIN`
- [x] `Manager.Security.deactivateSecureMode(confirmingNormalPIN:)` — `.active/.duress → .pinOnly`; blob unwind TODO deferred to Step 4
- [x] `OccultaApp` schema includes `SecureModeConfig`
- [x] `Manager.App` with `eraseAllData()`
- [x] Unit tests via `TestKeyManager` + in-memory `ModelContainer` (29 tests)
- [x] **[security]** Rename SE key tag from `"secure.mode.pin"` to an opaque string (UUID or similar). The current tag explicitly names the feature — Keychain enumeration by a forensic tool directly reveals Secure Mode infrastructure. The master identity key uses `"master.key.privacy.turtles.are.cute"` (opaque); the Secure Mode key should follow the same pattern.
- [x] **[security]** Rename `SecureModeConfig` to an opaque class name (e.g. `AppLayerConfig`). SwiftData derives the SQLite table name from the class name — `ZSECUREMODECONFIG` in a raw database dump directly names the feature. Renaming to something non-descriptive changes the table name to `ZAPPLAYERCONFIG` or similar. Class is only referenced internally; surgical rename with no public API impact. Requires a SwiftData migration (lightweight: rename only).
- [x] **[security]** Set `NSPersistentStoreFileProtectionKey: FileProtectionType.complete` on the SwiftData persistent store. The current default (`completeUntilFirstUserAuthentication`) leaves the SQLite file readable after first device unlock even when the screen is locked. SwiftData's `ModelConfiguration` doesn't expose this — requires setting file attributes on the store URL post-creation via `FileManager.setAttributes`. Note: all field values are additionally encrypted at the app level, so the exposure is schema + row count, not plaintext data.

---

## Step 2 — PIN Entry UI ✅

- [x] `PINEntry` view — neutral black, no branding
- [x] 6-digit keypad, `isVerifying` lock preventing double-submission
- [x] Fixed 500ms gate equalising timing across all outcomes
- [x] Two-phase setup: first entry stores PIN, second confirms; label switches "Passcode" → "Confirm Passcode"
- [x] Routes on result: `.normal` → `onNormal(String)`, `.duress` → `onDuress()`, `.wrong` → shake, `.wipe` → `onWipe()`
- [x] Reads `Manager.Security` from environment; counter lifetime off the view
- [x] `onNormal: (String) -> Void` (widened from `()` so Settings can pass PIN to `deactivatePIN`)
- [x] App launch gate in `OccultaApp` — `isLocked` state, `.overlay` on `TabView`, no animation, locks on every `scenePhase == .active`
- [x] **[security]** Also set `isLocked = true` on `scenePhase == .inactive`. iOS captures the app-switcher screenshot on `.inactive` (before going to background), while the current implementation only locks on `.active` (returning to foreground). Every time the user backgrounds the app, the live screen content is frozen in the app switcher and readable without unlocking.
- [x] **[security]** Zero PIN digits after use. Replace `[Int]` digits storage with a `Data`-backed buffer; after `submit()` routes the result, zero the buffer with `memset`. Removes PIN heap residue. Low practical exploit risk given SE binding, but correct hygiene and removes the finding from security audits.
- [ ] `onWipe` wired to `Manager.App.eraseAllData()` — **deferred; dry-test first**

---

## Step 3 — Settings UI + Contact Classification + Decoy View

### Settings → Security (4-state)

- [x] "Enable PIN" toggle — transitions `.noPIN ↔ .pinOnly` via `PINEntry` sheet
- [x] **[security]** Add `checkNormalPIN(_ pin: String) -> Bool` to `Manager.Security` — thin wrapper around `PINManager.checkVerifier` with no counter mutation. Replace the `security.verify()` call in `PINEntry.submitConfirmPhase` with this method. Using `verify()` for Settings-level PIN confirmation incorrectly increments `wrongPINCount` on each wrong attempt, which is semantically wrong (a Settings confirmation is not a lock-screen attack attempt) and pollutes the in-memory counter state.
- [x] "Activate Secure Mode" button — visible when `state == .pinOnly`. Sheet uses `PINEntry(mode: .confirmThenSet)`: phase 1 confirms normal PIN via `checkNormalPIN`, phase 2 enters + confirms duress PIN, calls `activateSecureMode(confirmingNormalPIN:duressPIN:)` on success.
- [x] "Deactivate Secure Mode" button — visible when `state == .active`. Sheet with `PINEntry` in verify mode; calls `deactivateSecureMode(confirmingNormalPIN:)` on success.
- [x] `state == .duress` → Settings → Security shows "Enable PIN" toggle `on` only (Activate and Deactivate buttons are already state-gated and invisible at `.duress`). Toggle tap opens verify sheet; coercer cannot disable PIN without the normal PIN; `deactivatePIN` throws `.invalidStateTransition` for non-`.pinOnly` anyway.
- [ ] **[design]** Contact selection must be part of the activation flow, not a standalone Settings item visited later. A user who activates Secure Mode without designating safe contacts will see an empty decoy — which is more suspicious than a populated one. The activation sheet must be a sequential multi-step flow: (1) confirm normal PIN, (2) enter + confirm duress PIN, (3) select safe contacts, (4) confirm and call `activateSecureMode`. The existing single-step `confirmThenSet` sheet is insufficient for this.
- [x] **[design]** "Deactivate Secure Mode" sheet calls `verify()` internally (via `PINEntry` in `.verify` mode), then `onNormal` calls `deactivateSecureMode(confirmingNormalPIN:)` which calls `PINManager.checkVerifier` again — double-verification plus counter mutation. Wrong attempts in this sheet increment `wrongPINCount` and can trigger wipe. Replace with a verify-without-counters path using `checkNormalPIN`, same as the activate flow's phase 1. Requires either a new `PINEntry` mode or calling `checkNormalPIN` directly in the sheet.
- [x] **[design]** "Enable PIN" toggle is interactive in `.active` and `.duress` states, but `deactivatePIN` throws `.invalidStateTransition` for both — the sheet opens, the user enters their PIN, and nothing visibly happens. Disable the toggle (`.disabled(true)`) when `state == .active || state == .duress` so the interaction is blocked at the UI layer. This is not a security issue (state machine is correct), but it is a silent failure in the current UX.
- [x] **[security]** `activateSecureMode` must validate that the proposed duress PIN does not open any existing normal verifier. Currently no collision check — if duress PIN == normal PIN, `verify()` always matches normal first and duress is never triggerable. Validate with `PINManager.checkVerifier` (not `verify()`) before building the duress verifier; reject with a user-facing error if any existing verifier opens.

### Contact classification

Contact visibility is tracked per-contact, not in a central list on `AppLayerConfig`. A single encrypted field on `Contact.Profile` encodes depth-aware visibility, scales to the Phase 2 stack without schema changes, and produces no central field whose size can be compared against total row count.

**`visibleThroughDepth: Data?`** on `Contact.Profile` — encrypted `Int?`:
- `nil` — visible at all depths (default for all new contacts)
- `0` — hidden at all duress depths (sensitive contact)
- `N` — visible through duress depth N, hidden at N+1 and deeper

Filter at depth N: show contacts where `decrypt(visibleThroughDepth) == nil || decrypt(visibleThroughDepth) >= N`.

Phase 1 (single duress layer, depth 1) only ever writes `nil` (safe) or `0` (sensitive). Phase 2 uses the full integer range without schema migration.

**Forensic profile:** `AES-GCM(nil)`, `AES-GCM(0)`, `AES-GCM(1)` all produce identically-sized ciphertexts — no size-based count inference. No central list to compare against total row count. The primary residual tell is the mass `ZMODIFICATIONDATE` update on safe contacts at activation time (Step 4 re-encrypts their fields under the new SE key). Mitigated by also touching hidden contacts' records with a no-op write at activation, making all N records share the same modification timestamp — no count inference possible.

- [x] `isSafeContact(_:)`, `safeContactIDs()` on `Manager.Security` — **implementation must be updated** to read `visibleThroughDepth` from contact records at `currentDepth`, not from `AppLayerConfig`
- [ ] Add `visibleThroughDepth: Data?` to `Contact.Profile` model (encrypted `Int?`, default nil)
- [ ] User chooses contact type (safe / sensitive) during contact creation — a neutral UI choice ("visibility") with no Secure Mode framing. All contacts have this field from day one regardless of whether Secure Mode is configured.
- [ ] At Secure Mode activation: review step shows existing contacts and lets the user confirm or change classifications before activating. This replaces the separate safe-contact picker that was previously planned as part of the activation sheet.
- [ ] `Manager.Security.isSafeContact(_:)` and `safeContactIDs()` updated to query `Contact.Profile.visibleThroughDepth` at `currentDepth` rather than decrypting a list from `AppLayerConfig`
- [ ] Remove `safeContactIDsEncrypted` from `AppLayerConfig` and all call sites (`isSafeContact`, `safeContactIDs`, `updateSafeContacts` on `Manager.Security`)

### Decoy view

- [ ] `ContactsV2` checks `security.isDuressActive`; filters fetch to `safeContactIDs()` when true
- [ ] `VaultTab` shows empty/unavailable state when `security.isDuressActive`
- [x] `onDuress` in `OccultaApp` wired: set `isLocked = false` (decoy view is the real app filtered — no special navigation)
- [ ] Inbound `.occ` from hidden contacts silently suppressed in duress mode; queued encrypted; processed on return to `.active`
- [ ] Safe contacts fully operational in decoy view (send, receive, decrypt `.occ`)
- [ ] New contacts created via key exchange while `isDuressActive` default to safe (`visibleThroughDepth = nil`). The exchange was performed openly in front of the coercer — there is no reason to hide the new contact. The default is the same as any other new contact in any mode.
- [ ] **[design]** `ExchangeManager` in duress mode — no gate. Silently rejecting an incoming invitation while the exchange UI lights up on the other device is itself a tell (the coercer sees an attempt that produces nothing). Exchanges should proceed normally. A re-exchange with a hidden contact creates a new record with their public key but their name and details remain locked in the blob (unreadable), so the coercer sees an unnamed new contact — indistinguishable from a fresh exchange with a stranger. The only residual risk is fingerprint correlation (Diceware words), which requires a highly targeted adversary who memorised the fingerprint from a prior session. This risk is accepted for Phase 1; revisit if targeted-adversary scenarios are added to the threat model.

---

## Step 4 — Blob (Activation / Deactivation)

- [ ] `SecureMode+Blob` — each stack payload serialises:
  - Per sensitive contact: persistent model ID + plaintext field data re-encrypted under blob key
  - Sensitive contact identity public keys
  - **Vault PEKs only** (not vault file data). Each vault entry's Per-Entry Key, unwrapped and re-wrapped under the blob key. Vault files remain on disk encrypted with their PEKs — locked in-place without moving file data. Blob size is independent of vault storage size.
  - Prekeys are not serialised — locked in-place alongside contact rows; fresh prekeys generated on restore.
- [ ] Blob is a stack of independently-encrypted payloads in a single file. Push appends; pop removes outermost. Partial-read reveals nothing about other layers.
- [ ] Blob encryption: `AES-GCM(HKDF(seKey, info: "blob-key"), content)`. SE binding prevents offline attacks. No PBKDF2 (same rationale as PIN verifier).
- [ ] Each payload padded to nearest power-of-2 bucket boundary before encryption. File size reveals only bucket tier, not contact/vault count.
- [ ] Blob file: no header, no magic bytes, no version field, no layer count. UUID filename with `.occbak` extension — indistinguishable from vault backup.
- [ ] **[security]** Create the blob with a no-op encrypted payload on first app launch — before Secure Mode is ever configured. Every Occulta install then has a blob file in the App Group container from day one; its presence is no longer Secure Mode-specific. A forensic examiner seeing the blob cannot distinguish "Secure Mode was used" from "this is a normal Occulta install."
- [ ] Continuous background blob maintenance triggered by `ModelContext.didSave`. Debounced 30s. Blob exists with natural timestamps before first activation.
- [ ] No-op blob rewrites on a 24h schedule — decouples Last Modified timestamp from meaningful events.
- [ ] **Activation sequence — key rotation, no row deletion:**
  1. Generate new SE key for this layer
  2. Read safe contact IDs while old SE key is live
  3. Serialise sensitive contacts (not soft-deleted, not in safe set) → blob payload
  4. Serialise vault PEKs → blob payload
  5. Re-encrypt safe contacts' fields under new DB key
  6. Re-encrypt `safeContactIDsEncrypted` under new DB key
  7. Delete old SE key — sensitive rows locked in-place
  8. Build verifiers; update `SecureModeConfig`
- [ ] **Deactivation sequence:**
  1. Decrypt blob payload
  2. For each (persistentModelID, data): fetch row by ID, UPDATE fields re-encrypted under new DB key
  3. Generate new vault SE key; restore vault PEKs via UPDATE
  4. Generate fresh prekeys for restored contacts
  5. Remove blob payload; update `SecureModeConfig` verifiers
- [ ] `SecureModeOperation` SwiftData record — tracks activation/deactivation stage. Written before operation begins, deleted on clean completion. All fields encrypted; record's existence must not reveal the operation type. **On next launch, incomplete record → automatic resume or rollback:**
  - Resume: re-enter the operation from the last completed stage (idempotent stage design required)
  - Rollback: restore the previous verifier state, delete any partial blob payload, leave DB rows in their pre-operation encrypted state
  - Activation failure before old SE key deletion → safe to retry from scratch
  - Activation failure after old SE key deletion → must complete forward (no rollback possible; resume is the only path)
  - Runs in a background `Task`; user sees a progress indicator; app backgrounding suspends and resumes on next foreground
- [ ] Blob stored in App Group container (`group.com.occulta.shared`) with `.completeFileProtection`.
- [ ] **[security]** Set `isExcludedFromBackup = true` (`URLResourceValues`) on the blob file immediately after creation. Without this, the blob is included in iCloud backups by default. A forensic examiner with iCloud credentials or a court order can recover the blob from a backup taken before a wipe, reversing the wipe entirely. `.completeFileProtection` does not prevent iCloud backup.
- [ ] **[security]** After the activation sequence completes, run `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` on the persistent store before deleting the old SE key. A standard checkpoint stops new WAL entries but leaves existing frames intact. `TRUNCATE` checkpoints and then zeroes the WAL file to zero bytes, fully eliminating the re-encryption transition record. A forensic snapshot post-activation then finds an empty WAL with no mass UPDATE event to timestamp.

---

## Step 5 — Wipe + Panic Trigger

- [x] `PINEntry` shown on every `scenePhase == .active` when `security.requiresPIN`
- [x] `onDuress` / `onWipe` stubs in place (empty — dry-test deferred)
- [ ] `onWipe` wired to `Manager.App.eraseAllData()` — **after dry-testing the full flow**
- [ ] **[security]** `eraseAllData()` must also delete the blob file from the App Group container. Currently it covers prekeys, contacts, vault, and SE keys but has no knowledge of the blob. When Step 4 lands, `Manager.App.eraseAllData()` must receive a reference to the blob file path and delete it as part of the wipe sequence — before SE key deletion so the deletion itself cannot be blocked by an encrypted path lookup.
- [ ] `onOpenURL` respects Secure Mode — inbound `.occ` queued until PIN entered; hidden contact fingerprint lookup returns "unknown sender"
- [ ] Panic trigger accessible from decoy view — back tap or shake — calls `eraseAllData()` immediately without confirmation
- [ ] **Decryption-failure contract** — enforced at `ContactManager`, the single data authority. All fetch and search methods return `nil` (not empty string, not placeholder) for rows that fail decryption. The contract is: `decryptOrNil() == nil` is treated identically to "row never existed" by every caller — no secondary queries, no error logs, no timing differences.
  - A new wrapper type (`SecureModeDataProvider`) is explicitly rejected: it would create a parallel access path and the contract would only be as strong as adoption is universal. Enforce it at the source.
  - **`SECURE_MODE_DECRYPT_CONTRACT.md`** — living checklist of every `decryptOrNil` call site, indexed by layer, process boundary (main app / Share Extension / notifications), and test coverage. Must be updated on every PR that touches contacts or vault. Signed off before Phase 1 ships.
- [ ] **Decryption side-channel audit** before shipping: activate Secure Mode in-memory, hide a contact, assert every query path (`ContactManager`, `ExchangeManager`, `IdentityChallenge`, Share Extension, notifications) returns same result as if the contact never existed. Includes timing: no path should take measurably longer on a decryption failure than on a genuine empty result.

---

## Phase 2 — Plausible Deniability Stack *(post-Phase-1)*

### Threat model

A coercer demands access at PIN-point. No matter how many PIN entries are coerced, the app behaves identically to an ordinary contacts app at every depth. The coercer cannot determine how many layers exist, whether they have reached the bottom, or whether any protected data has been withheld.

### Stack invariants

1. **Arbitrary depth.** No cap. A cap (e.g. VeraCrypt's 2-layer limit) is a smoking gun — a coercer who tries to activate another layer and finds it unavailable immediately knows hidden data exists. Every layer presents an identical "Activate Secure Mode" option.
2. **PIN entry on every foreground.** `PINEntry` is identical regardless of depth.
3. **`state == .duress` → Settings shows "Enable PIN" toggle + "Activate Secure Mode" only.** Never reveals whether a deeper layer is already configured. The UI at any depth > 0 is indistinguishable from `.pinOnly`.
4. **`currentDepth` is in-memory only.** Resets to 0 on every app kill. No persistent depth counter — that would be a forensic artifact. `currentDepth` is sufficient because the PIN itself is the routing key: after a cold start, entering any layer's PIN routes directly to that depth via the full normal-verifier scan (see `verify()` ordering below). `currentDepth` in memory only controls which duress push-down verifier is offered — you can only go one level deeper from where you currently are.
5. **Depth 0 = `.active`; depth > 0 = `.duress`.** There is no `.active` state at any depth > 0. "Returning" to depth N always produces `.duress` state with the decoy view for that level. Only depth 0 (master PIN) surfaces the real app.

### PIN model — one PIN per layer boundary

Each boundary between depth N and N+1 is guarded by a single PIN:

```
sealedNormalVerifiers[0]   = master PIN          → depth 0 (.active, real app)
sealedDuressVerifiers[0]   = duress PIN #0       → push depth 0 → depth 1
sealedNormalVerifiers[1]   = same value as sealedDuressVerifiers[0]  ← routing alias
sealedDuressVerifiers[1]   = duress PIN #1       → push depth 1 → depth 2
sealedNormalVerifiers[2]   = same value as sealedDuressVerifiers[1]  ← routing alias
...
```

`sealedNormalVerifiers[N]` (N > 0) and `sealedDuressVerifiers[N-1]` hold the same PIN value. The duress PIN that pushes you to depth N is the same PIN that returns you to depth N from any deeper level. This gives **K+1 distinct PINs for K layers** — no separate "return PIN" to remember per layer.

### `AppLayerConfig` — Phase 2 schema extension

Parallel arrays in the existing single row (no new rows, no joins):

```swift
// Added for Phase 2 — Phase 1 fields unchanged
var sealedNormalVerifiers:    [Data]   // index = depth; [0] is master; [N] == sealedDuressVerifiers[N-1]
var sealedDuressVerifiers:    [Data]   // index = depth; entry at N drives push to N+1
```

The existing `sealedNormalVerifier` / `sealedDuressVerifier` fields become `sealedNormalVerifiers[0]` / `sealedDuressVerifiers[0]`. Migration: on first Phase 2 launch, wrap existing single values into index-0 of the arrays.

There is no `safeContactIDsPerLevel` array. Contact visibility across all depths is encoded in `Contact.Profile.visibleThroughDepth` (see Step 3). Filter at depth N: show contacts where `decrypt(visibleThroughDepth) == nil || decrypt(visibleThroughDepth) >= N`.

**Contact visibility invariants across layers:**

- A contact with `visibleThroughDepth = K` is visible at all depths 0..K and hidden at K+1 and deeper. Visibility is always a contiguous range from depth 0 — a contact cannot be hidden at depth 1 but visible at depth 2.
- When activating depth N+1, the user reviews contacts with `visibleThroughDepth >= N` (visible at current depth) and selects which should also be visible at N+1 (setting `visibleThroughDepth = N+1` or leaving at `nil`). Contacts not selected remain at their current value and become hidden at depth N+1.
- New contacts created at any depth default to `visibleThroughDepth = nil` (visible at all depths). They were exchanged with openly; hiding them retroactively requires an explicit user action.
- At activation, all N contact records receive a no-op write to unify `ZMODIFICATIONDATE` — prevents count inference from timestamp distribution.

### `verify()` ordering at any depth

Given `currentDepth = N`:

1. Try **all** `sealedNormalVerifiers[0..max]` — first match at K: `currentDepth = K`, state = `.active` if K == 0 else `.duress`; restore blobs for depths K+1..N if K < N
2. Try `sealedDuressVerifiers[N]` → match: `currentDepth = N+1`, state = `.duress`
3. No match → `.wrong`; increment `wrongPINCount`

Step 1 scans all normal verifiers regardless of `currentDepth`. This is what makes cold-start routing work — entering duress PIN #1 after a kill matches `sealedNormalVerifiers[2]` and routes directly to depth 2, without having to walk through depth 1 first. Only the push-down (step 2) is depth-specific, preventing a coercer from jumping past an unvisited depth.

### Activation at depth N — confirmation PIN

When at depth N and tapping "Activate Secure Mode" to add depth N+1:

- **N == 0**: confirm via `checkNormalPIN` (master PIN). Already implemented for Phase 1.
- **N > 0**: confirm via `checkDuressPIN(N-1)` — check `sealedDuressVerifiers[N-1]`, the PIN that brought the user to depth N. Requires a new `Manager.Security.checkCurrentLayerEntryPIN(_ pin: String) -> Bool` method for Phase 2. Using `checkNormalPIN` here would expose the master PIN to an observer during depth-2+ setup.

The activation flow at any depth: (1) confirm entry PIN for this depth, (2) enter + confirm new duress PIN, (3) select safe contacts for next level, (4) call `activateSecureModeAtCurrentDepth(confirmingEntryPIN:newDuressPIN:safeContacts:)`.

### PIN uniqueness constraint

At every setup step, validate the candidate PIN against all existing verifiers at all depths. Reject if any verifier opens with the candidate PIN.

**[security]** This validation must use a pure `checkPIN(_:against:)` method — not `verify()`. `verify()` increments `wrongPINCount` on each non-match. Checking N verifiers for uniqueness would increment the counter N times, potentially triggering a spurious wipe. `PINManager.checkVerifier()` already exists as a pure function; the Phase 2 uniqueness check must call it directly without going through `Manager.Security.verify()`.

### Cascade delete

Disabling Secure Mode at depth N (i.e. calling `deactivateSecureMode` at depth N) must truncate `sealedNormalVerifiers` and `sealedDuressVerifiers` to length N, and restore all blob payloads at indices N+1…end. Orphaned deeper configs are unreachable and must not be left in the store. Contact visibility (`visibleThroughDepth` per contact) is not cascaded — the values remain valid and the user retains whatever classifications they set. A contact visible only through depth N becomes unreachable after the stack is truncated to N; its `visibleThroughDepth` value is harmless to leave in place.

### What Occulta adopts from VeraCrypt — and what it rejects

| Concept | Decision |
|---|---|
| No magic bytes in blob | **Adopted** |
| Fixed bucket sizes | **Adopted** |
| No-metadata blob format | **Adopted** |
| Two-layer cap | **Rejected** — any cap is a smoking gun |
| Outer/inner volume sharing physical space | **Not applicable** — Occulta uses an append-only stack file |

## Known Limitations

- **Row count mismatch.** More rows exist than the app displays. Soft-deleted and locked rows each have plausible innocent explanations. Soft-deleted rows are capped at 50 per entity type (evicted FIFO) to prevent unbounded database growth. Soft-deleted rows must never appear in any UI, Share Index, or query result.
- **SE key rotation is observable. No mitigation.** A forensic examiner checking the Keychain will see a new SE key created and an old one deleted. The timestamp is correlatable with activation. The deletion IS the security mechanism — there is no way to hide it.
- **The blob file exists. Mitigated.** Blob is created on first app launch (before Secure Mode is ever used), UUID-named, and continuously maintained. Its presence is then universal across all Occulta installs and is no longer Secure Mode-specific.
- **App deletion while Secure Mode is active is unrecoverable. No mitigation.** The App Group container is deleted with the app. This is an OS constraint. Users must be warned before activation; no code fix is possible.
- **Counter resets on app kill. Mitigated by panic trigger.** `wrongPINCount` and `consecutiveDuressCount` are in-memory only. A coercer who kills and relaunches resets the wipe counter. The panic trigger (Step 5) provides a user-controlled wipe that does not depend on the counter.
- **SwiftData schema name is a forensic artifact. Mitigated.** Renaming `SecureModeConfig` to an opaque class name (Step 1) changes the table name to something non-descriptive. The schema fingerprint survives row deletion (store file is not deleted by `eraseAllData()`), but the table name no longer names the feature.
- **SwiftData WAL captures re-encryption transitions. Mitigated.** `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` after activation (Step 4) zeroes the WAL file, eliminating the re-encryption timestamp record entirely.
- **Mass `ZMODIFICATIONDATE` update at activation is a deniability tell. Mitigated.** Re-encrypting safe contacts' fields under the new SE key at activation produces a mass timestamp update on a subset of contact rows — count inference possible by comparing updated rows against total row count. Mitigated by issuing a no-op write to all N contact records at activation, unifying `ZMODIFICATIONDATE` across the full table. No count inference is possible when every row shares the same modification timestamp.
- **HKDF with PIN in the `info` field is non-standard. No mitigation planned.** `HKDF(inputKeyMaterial: seKey, info: label ∥ pin)` works correctly. Migrating to a more standard construction (PIN as IKM) would invalidate all existing verifiers. The current scheme has no known exploit; the finding is documented for external audits.
- **PIN strings are not zeroed after use. Mitigated.** Replacing `[Int]` digit storage with a `Data`-backed buffer and zeroing with `memset` after routing (Step 2) removes PIN heap residue.
- **Secure Mode raises the bar against coercion and mid-tier adversaries. It is not state-actor proof.**
